This repository is the complete code for the tutorial on SosNoob.com : "How te build your own web scraper easily?"
You need a web site data to build a database or an API with it ? This tuto is for you !

The program can be export as an ".exe" (so don't need to have any dependency installed) and generate your data into JSON files. You can also modify it to directly push data on your database / API. For this example I scrap Github's data, especially the result list of "Javascript" in Github's search area.

The program use `pkg` dependency which allow you to export it as an executable for : </br>
- `Windows`
- `OSX` 
- `Linux`

**So you or your community don't need any dependency once it export (no node js).**
